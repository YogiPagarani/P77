            <p>Visual Studio is a super helpful tool made by Microsoft
                for building computer programs. To set it up, go to Microsoft's 
                website, download it, and choose what kind of programs you want to make. 
                It's like a digital toolbox that helps you write code and fix mistakes easily, 
                making it great for people who want to create all sorts of cool software. You can make anything you imagine 
                </p>

                    A console screen is like a computer's 
                    text-based chat where you give commands using words. 
                    You type instructions, hit Enter, and the computer responds with
                     information or actions. It's a simple way to talk to your computer 
                     in a language it understands.
